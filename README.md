### README for Simple Library System Exercise

# üìö Simple Library System in Python

Welcome, students! üöÄ This exercise is tailored to enhance your grasp on object-oriented programming, dictionaries, and basic regular expression validation in Python.

## üéØ Objectives

- Implement and comprehend the mechanics of a basic library system.
- Develop classes and functions that interact to simulate a library.
- Validate method implementations through testing and debugging.

## üîç Overview

Your primary working file is `exercise.py`, which contains stubs for the `Book` and `Library` classes. Each class has methods you must implement.

`exercise.py` also contains a `driver()` function that demonstrates how each method works and provides log messages to elucidate the expected behavior of each method. 

As you go about implementing each method, you can uncomment its respective lines in the `driver()` function to validate its functionality.

## ‚úÖ Tasks

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand the Distribution Code

While inside `exercise.py`:
- Go through each function's docstrings to understand the desired implementation.
- Run the command:

```bash
python exercise.py
````

- Also run before starting on the terminal

````bash
pytest
````

You should run this after completing each function to verify that it was correctly implemented. Once
all tests pass you can submit your code for review.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing the function

Implement each function in the TODO. Do the following steps:

- Add your implementation
- Uncomment corresponding section on driver() and run `python exercise.py` to make
sure it works as you intenteded.
- Run `pytest` to make sure it passsed the tests


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Committing and Pushing Changes using VSCode Codespaces

Once all the tests have completed:

1. **Stage Changes**: 
   - View your changes in the Source Control view.
   - Click on the `+` (plus) sign next to the files you wish to stage.
2. **Commit Changes**: 
   - Enter a descriptive commit message.
   - Press `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter` on macOS) to commit the changes.
3. **Push Changes**: 
   - Click on the ellipsis `...` in the Source Control view.
   - Select **Push**.
4. **Verify you code has passed**: 


## üìò Resources

- **OOP in Python**: Review foundational knowledge with Python‚Äôs [OOP documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
## ü§î Need Help?

- **Clarifications**: Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for clarifications regarding the functionality of the on Discord.
- **Debugging**: If you‚Äôre grappling with bugs or issues, seek help! Debugging is key to learning.
- **Answer**: We have a file called the_answer.py. Only look at it if you are stuck for some time (30 min+)

Should your functions exhibit unexpected behaviors or issues:
- Place breakpoints in your code within VSCode.
- Use the VSCode debugger to navigate through your code, inspect variables, and diagnose potential issues.
- Modify your code as needed, guided by your findings during debugging.
